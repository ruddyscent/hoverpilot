# HoverPilot

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)

Minimal Python client to connect to RealFlight Link (TCP 18083), exchange RC commands, and expose a Gymnasium-compatible hover environment.

## Quickstart

Recommended with `uv`:

```bash
uv sync
cp .env.example .env
uv run hoverpilot-demo
```

If you prefer module execution, this also works after `uv sync`:

```bash
uv run python -m hoverpilot.main
```

Legacy `pip` workflow:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e .
cp .env.example .env
python -m hoverpilot.main
```

## Gymnasium Environment

The project now exposes a Gymnasium-style environment:

```python
import numpy as np

from hoverpilot.config import HOST, PORT
from hoverpilot.envs import HoverPilotHoverEnv

env = HoverPilotHoverEnv(
    host=HOST,
    port=PORT,
    max_episode_steps=250,
)
observation, info = env.reset()
action = np.asarray([0.0, 0.0, 0.55, 0.0], dtype=np.float32)
observation, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action)
```

The API mirrors Gymnasium:

- `reset(...) -> (observation, info)`
- `step(action) -> (observation, reward, terminated, truncated, info)`

Action format is a 4-element `float32` array:

- index 0: `aileron` in `[-1, 1]`
- index 1: `elevator` in `[-1, 1]`
- index 2: `throttle` in `[0, 1]`
- index 3: `rudder` in `[-1, 1]`

Observation format is a compact 12-element `float32` vector for hover training:

- position: `x`, `y`, `altitude_agl`
- attitude: `roll`, `inclination`, `azimuth`
- world velocity: `u`, `v`, `w`
- angular rates: `pitch_rate`, `roll_rate`, `yaw_rate`

Reward and termination are integrated from `hoverpilot.training.hover`:

- reward prefers staying near the target hover point and upright attitude
- boundary proximity adds a growing penalty before failure
- terminal failures include trainer boundary exit, altitude bounds, lost components, locked vehicle states, configured controller inactivity, configured engine stop, and post-start ground contact

`reset()` waits for a usable start state before returning. During this warmup the environment keeps sending a safe idle action and polls RealFlight until readiness is satisfied or a timeout is reached.

### RealFlight Link host

By default the client connects to `127.0.0.1:18083`. That is only correct when
Python and RealFlight are running in the same network namespace. From a Docker
container, VM, WSL instance, or Jetson talking to another machine, set
`RFLINK_HOST` to the host/IP address that is reachable from that shell:

```bash
RFLINK_HOST=<realflight-host-ip> uv run --no-sync hoverpilot-demo
```

If startup reports `unable to connect to RealFlight Link`, verify that
RealFlight is running, RealFlight Link is enabled, TCP port `18083` is reachable,
and `RFLINK_HOST` is not still pointing at the container's own loopback address.

## Demo

Run:

```bash
python -m hoverpilot.main
```

The demo prints:

- observation shape
- scalar reward
- `terminated` / `truncated`
- termination reason when present
- current AGL altitude from `info["debug_state"]`
- a concise RealFlight state summary

The demo keeps running across episodes and only stops on `KeyboardInterrupt`. During reset wait periods it rate-limits the `waiting for trainer reset` log to avoid flooding the terminal.

## Episode Lifecycle

`Airplane Hover Trainer` does not always expose a clean explicit reset flag through RealFlight Link, so the environment manages episode lifecycle conservatively.

Episode start:

- `reset()` and reset-wait polling both use a safe idle action.
- A state is considered ready when it is not obviously uninitialized, not locked, and not already failed.
- Controller-active and engine-running checks are available as configurable readiness gates because these fields can behave differently across trainer modes.
- Ground contact is allowed during startup by default because some trainer resets spawn on or very near the ground.

Episode end:

- Hard terminal failures include:
  - `m_hasLostComponents > threshold`
  - boundary exit in `x` or `y`
  - altitude too low / too high
  - locked vehicle state
  - configured controller inactive / engine stopped conditions
  - post-start ground contact after the configured grace period
- `m_currentAircraftStatus` is currently treated as opaque. It is exposed in `info["debug_state"]`, and only becomes terminal if you explicitly configure known terminal status codes.

Reset-wait and restart:

- After termination, the environment keeps polling with a safe idle action until a new episode can be started.
- Restart signals are checked in this order:
  - reset button pressed
  - physics time rollback
  - trainer-driven reposition / teleport into a reset-like stationary state
- In the current Airplane Hover Trainer setup, the more semantic crash / recovery flags
  (`m_hasLostComponents`, `m_anEngineIsRunning`, `m_isTouchingGround`) often stay fixed at
  `0`, so they are still exposed in `debug_state` but are not used as primary reset signals.
  You can verify that behavior with:
  `RFLINK_DEBUG_STATE_FLAGS=1 python -m hoverpilot.main`

Useful tuning parameters on `HoverPilotHoverEnv`:

- readiness / warmup:
  - `max_reset_wait_seconds`
  - `reset_poll_interval_seconds`
  - `ready_controller_active_threshold`
  - `ready_running_threshold`
  - `ready_locked_threshold`
  - `allow_ground_contact_at_ready`
- teleport fallback:
  - `reposition_speed_threshold_mps`
  - `reset_teleport_distance_m`
- termination thresholds via `RewardConfig`:
  - `controller_active_threshold`
  - `terminate_on_engine_stopped`
  - `ground_contact_grace_seconds`
  - `known_terminal_aircraft_status_codes`

The environment prefers explicit RealFlight Link reset signals first. Teleport / reposition detection is kept as a fallback because the Hover Trainer can reset by suddenly moving the aircraft without updating the more semantic lifecycle flags.

## PPO Training and Environment Validation

A lightweight PPO trainer is now available in `hoverpilot.rl.ppo`.

## NVIDIA Jetson with NGC PyTorch Container

HoverPilot can be run on NVIDIA Jetson inside an NVIDIA NGC PyTorch container using
the provided Compose file [compose.jetson.yml](/Users/kwchun/Workspace/hover-pilot/compose.jetson.yml).

Prerequisites on the Jetson host:

- JetPack 5.0.2 or newer installed on the device
- NVIDIA Container Toolkit configured for Docker
- Docker access for your user
- NGC login completed with `docker login nvcr.io`

HoverPilot's Jetson container workflow assumes a JetPack 5.x class environment with
Ubuntu 20.04 / Python 3.8. JetPack 5.0.2 is the minimum supported baseline in this
README because it is the first production-quality JetPack 5 release and supports
NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX modules.

The exact NGC image tag must match the JetPack / L4T release on the device.
Use [.env.example](/Users/kwchun/Workspace/hover-pilot/.env.example) as a template:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then set the NGC image in `.env`:

```bash
HOVERPILOT_NGC_IMAGE=nvcr.io/nvidia/<official-jetson-pytorch-image>:<matching-tag>
```

Bring up the container:

```bash
docker compose -f compose.jetson.yml up -d
docker compose -f compose.jetson.yml exec hoverpilot bash
```

The project source tree is mounted into `/workspace/hover-pilot` inside the container.

### Using uv Without Replacing Container PyTorch

The NGC image already includes NVIDIA's Jetson-optimized PyTorch build.
To keep `uv` from replacing that PyTorch installation:

```bash
cd /workspace/hover-pilot
export UV_PYTHON=/usr/bin/python3
uv venv --python /usr/bin/python3 --system-site-packages
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__)"
uv sync --python /usr/bin/python3 --extra rl --no-install-package torch --inexact
python3 -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__)"
```

Why this setup:

- `uv venv --python /usr/bin/python3 --system-site-packages` creates the project environment from the Jetson container's system Python instead of a uv-managed Python
- `--system-site-packages` lets the virtual environment see the PyTorch already installed in the container
- `--no-install-package torch` tells `uv` not to install its own `torch`
- `--inexact` avoids removing packages already provided by the container image

If `uv sync` prints a different interpreter version and recreates `.venv`, remove the
environment and repeat the steps above with `UV_PYTHON=/usr/bin/python3` set.

After that, prefer `uv run --no-sync ...` so execution does not try to resync and replace packages:

```bash
uv run --no-sync hoverpilot-demo
uv run --no-sync hoverpilot-validate --episodes 2 --max-episode-steps 100
uv run --no-sync hoverpilot-ppo train --timesteps 50000 --save-path ppo_hoverpilot.pt
```

Run TensorBoard from inside the container:

```bash
uv run --no-sync tensorboard --host 0.0.0.0 --port 6006 --logdir runs
```

Because the Compose file uses host networking on Jetson, TensorBoard is then available at:

```text
http://<jetson-ip>:6006
```

Install the optional RL dependency:

```bash
uv sync --extra rl
```

If torch installation fails (e.g., on Alpine aarch64), install the base package instead:

```bash
uv sync
```

Train a policy (requires torch):

```bash
uv run hoverpilot-ppo train --timesteps 50000 --save-path ppo_hoverpilot.pt
```

Training writes TensorBoard logs to `runs/hoverpilot-ppo` by default.

Customize training with additional options:

```bash
uv run hoverpilot-ppo train --timesteps 50000 \
  --save-path ppo_hoverpilot.pt \
  --max-episode-steps 300 \
  --n-steps 2048 \
  --batch-size 128 \
  --epochs 10 \
  --learning-rate 3e-4 \
  --gamma 0.99 \
  --gae-lambda 0.95 \
  --clip-epsilon 0.2 \
  --value-coef 0.5 \
  --entropy-coef 0.01 \
  --max-grad-norm 0.5 \
  --eval-episodes 5 \
  --log-interval 10 \
  --tensorboard-log-dir runs/hoverpilot-ppo-exp1 \
  --seed 42
```

The PPO CLI now exposes these tuning parameters directly:

- `--n-steps`
- `--batch-size`
- `--epochs`
- `--learning-rate`
- `--gamma`
- `--gae-lambda`
- `--clip-epsilon`
- `--value-coef`
- `--entropy-coef`
- `--max-grad-norm`

To disable TensorBoard logging for a run:

```bash
uv run hoverpilot-ppo train --timesteps 50000 --disable-tensorboard
```

Monitor training with TensorBoard:

```bash
uv run tensorboard --logdir runs
```

Then open `http://localhost:6006`.

Useful TensorBoard scalars include:

- `train/episode_reward`
- `train/episode_length`
- `train/reward_mean`
- `train/action/throttle_mean`
- `train/termination/parked_on_ground`
- `train/policy_loss`
- `train/value_loss`
- `train/entropy`
- `eval/avg_reward`

Validate the environment before training:

```bash
uv run hoverpilot-validate --episodes 2 --max-episode-steps 100
```

This validation command helps confirm:

- `reset()` behavior and `episode_start_reason`
- observation shape and bounds
- action scaling across the drone control channels
- reward and termination signals during short episodes
- whether boundary termination is firing too aggressively
